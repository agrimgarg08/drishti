# DRISHTI  
## AI-Driven Sustainability Operating System for Urban Water Systems (particularly the Yamuna)

Delhi contributes a majority of the Yamuna’s pollution despite covering only a small stretch of the river.  
Current interventions are reactive, fragmented, and lack continuous monitoring.

**DRISHTI** is a lightweight, real-time decision support platform that helps authorities detect pollution early, predict risks, and take targeted action.

Instead of waiting for damage, we enable a **monitor → predict → intervene** strategy.

## 🚨 Problem

- Untreated sewage enters through multiple drains
- Monitoring is sparse and manual
- Illegal/ intermittent dumping goes unnoticed
- STPs are overloaded or bypassed
- Agencies lack coordinated, real-time data

Result:  
By the time pollution is noticed, it’s already too late.

## 💡 Our Solution

We built a **smart environmental monitoring system** that:

- Continuously collects sensor data
- Detects anomalies automatically
- Simulates pollution risk
- Tracks issues
- Visualizes everything on one dashboard

It acts as the **control center for river health**.

## 🧠 System Flow

Sensors → Database → AI/ML → Backend API → Dashboard → Action

- Sensors send water quality data
- ML detects abnormal spikes
- Alerts are generated automatically
- Officials raise issues and take action
- Policies can be simulated before deployment
